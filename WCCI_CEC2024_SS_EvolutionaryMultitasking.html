<b>Session abstract</b><br />
&emsp;&emsp; Evolutionary multitasking is an emerging concept in computational intelligence that realizes the theme of efficient multi-task problem-solving in the domain of numerical optimization [1-5]. It is worth noting that in the natural world, the process of evolution has, in a single run, successfully produced diverse living organisms that are skilled at survival in a variety of ecological niches. In other words, the process of evolution can itself be thought of as a massive multi-task engine where each niche forms a task in an otherwise complex multifaceted fitness landscape, and the population of all living organisms is simultaneously evolving to survive in one niche or the other. Interestingly, it may happen that the genetic material evolved for one task is effective for another as well, in which case the scope for inter-task genetic transfers facilitates frequent leaps in the evolutionary progression towards superior individuals. Being nature-inspired optimization procedures, it has recently been shown that evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are not only equipped to mimic Darwinian principles of “survival-of-the-fittest”, but their reproduction operators are also capable of inducing the afore-stated inter-task genetic transfers in multitask optimization settings; although, the practical implications of the latter are yet to be fully studied and exploited in the literature.<br />
