            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Evolutionary computation is a family of algorithms modeled on natural evolution. It applies mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and selection to a population of candidate solutions, allowing them to evolve over generations. This approach excels in exploring vast search spaces and addressing complex optimisation tasks, making it a powerful tool in fields like engineering and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the category of evolutionary computation encompasses several sub-categories and techniques. Here is a list of some of the main categories within this field:</p>
	<p>1. Genetic Algorithms (GA)</p>
	<p>2. Evolution Strategies (ES)</p>

	<p>4. Swarm Intelligence Algorithms</p>
	<p>5. Differential Evolution (DE)</p>
	<p>6. Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)</p>
	<p>7. Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), etc.</p>
<p>The dynamism and advanced research fields of evolutionary computation are vast and diverse, reflecting the ever-evolving nature of this field. Here is a list of some of the current dynamic and advanced research areas within evolutionary computation:</p>
	<p>• Hybridisation and Integration with Other Methods</p>
	<p>• Multi-objective Optimisation</p>
	<p>• Large-scale Optimisation</p>

         <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating the intricate design of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Over the past decade, NAS has captivated the attention and enthusiasm of both the Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning communities.</p>
   <p>Traditionally, NAS algorithms are grouped into three main categories based on their search methodologies:</p>
   <p>Reinforcement Learning</p>
   <p>Gradient-based Techniques</p>
   <p>Evolutionary Computation</p>
   <p>Yet, the landscape of NAS is continually evolving. Modern NAS innovations often defy these clear-cut classifications. Some algorithms exhibit characteristics spanning multiple categories, while others introduce groundbreaking architectural encodings that challenge conventional search methods.

   <p>The dynamism of this field is undeniable. Contemporary NAS techniques are pushing boundaries by enabling the design of complex Deep Neural Networks within stringent time constraints. This progress is driven by:</p></p>

   <p>Streamlined Search Spaces: Efficiently defined to focus on optimal solutions.</p>
   <p>GPU Optimisation: Leveraging the power of GPUs for accelerated computations.</p>
   <p>Approximation Techniques: Using intelligent approximating functions to enhance performance.</p>
   <p>Notably, while some NAS approaches excel in specific domains, others produce adaptable architectures, empowering users to effortlessly transition between diverse applications.</p>

   <p>This workshop aims to delve into the contemporary trends of NAS, explore its successes and challenges, and contemplate its future directions and broader impact within the AI community, industry, and society.</p>

            <p><strong>Overview:</strong>
<p>In our rapidly changing world, the ability to learn and adapt is paramount. This capability enables us to navigate complex challenges, leveraging our past experiences to avoid previous pitfalls and apply knowledge in novel contexts. Remarkably, the human capacity for selecting and generalising relevant experiences to new problems stands as a testament to our cognitive sophistication.</p>
<p>Within the context of computational intelligence, several core learning technologies in neural and cognitive systems, fuzzy systems, probabilistic and possibilistic reasoning, have shown promise in emulating the generalisation capabilities of human learning, with many now used routinely to enhance our daily lives. Recently, in contrast to traditional machine learning approaches, Transfer Learning, which uses data from related source tasks to augment learning in a new (target) task, has attracted extensive attention and demonstrated great success in a wide range of real-world applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc.</p>
<p>In spite of several advances in computational intelligence, it is noted that the attempts to emulate such cognitive capabilities in problem solvers, especially those of an evolutionary nature, have received far less attention. In fact, most existing evolutionary algorithms (EAs) remain ill-equipped to exploit the potentially rich sources of knowledge that may be embedded in previous searches. With this, and the observation that any practically useful industrial system is likely to face a large number of (possibly repetitive) problems over a lifetime, it is contended that novel research advances in both the theory and application of Transfer Learning, especially for Optimisation, are primed to bring about a new wave in the real-world impact of intelligent systems.</p>
<p>The main goal of this workshop is to promote the research on crafting novel algorithm designs as well as theoretical analysis towards “intelligent” evolutionary computation, which possesses the transfer capabilities that evolve along with the problems solved. Further, this workshop also aims at providing a forum for academic and industrial researchers to explore future directions of research and promote evolutionary computation techniques to a wider audience in the society of computer science and engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Trustworthiness is a critical issue in artificial intelligence (AI), especially for real-world AI applications. It is impossible to apply AI in the real-world without its being trustworthy. However, the connotation and extension of trustworthiness are not entirely clear to the scientific community. There has not been a single definition that is accepted by all researchers. Nevertheless, the vast majority of researchers agree that AI trustworthiness should include at least accuracy, reliability, robustness, safety, security, privacy, fairness, transparency, controllability, maintenability, etc. This talk first reviews briefly concepts like trust, trustworthiness and trustworthy systems in engineering. Then we discuss what might be new in trustworthy AI. It is argued that AI ethics is a crucial part of trustworthy AI, which was not highlighted in traditional trustworthy systems. We present a hirarchical and multi-dimensioanl view of AI ethics, including fairness, transparency, safety, etc. Finally, we focus on the latest technical solutions to some trustworthy issues in machine learning, including fairness, explanability and safety. It is shown how multi-objective evolutionary learning can be used as an effective approach to enhancing AI trustworthiness. </p>

        <div class="abstract">
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Secure and federated data-driven optimization is an emerging research area that aims to protect the data security and privacy used in optimization. This talk starts with an introduction to basic ideas of data-driven optimization and federated privacy-preserving data-driven optimization. To protect the privacy of both offline and online data, we introduce a secure federated data-driven optimization framework based on the Diffie-Hellman protocol, in which a semi-honest client is randomly chosen to solve the acquisition function and determine the next sample point, making sure that newly sampled data is also protected. To reduce the negative impact of the noise added in differential privacy, a utility function is proposed to optimize the noise level that can optimally balance privacy preservation and optimization performance. Finally, a federated multi-tasking data-driven optimization algorithm is presented that shares the hyperparameters of Gaussian processes for knowledge transfer, while protecting the data privacy. </p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has recently attracted great attention due to its importance in critical application domains such as self-driving cars, law, and healthcare. Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for AI, machine learning and AutoML. Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to the symbolic nature of the model structure. GP model interpretability has been playing an increasingly important role in XAI. This talk will first briefly overview explainable AI, then focus on how GP helps XAI in three aspects: intrinsic XGP, aiming to directly evolve more interpretable (and effective) models by GP; post-hoc XGP, which uses GP to explain other black-box machine learning models and the models evolved by GP by simpler models (e.g. linear models); and GP visualisation, which focuses on visual interpretability. Finally, I will discuss the challenges and future directions for XGP.    </p>
