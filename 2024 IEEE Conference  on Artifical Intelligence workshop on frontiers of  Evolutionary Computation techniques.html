            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Trustworthiness is a critical issue in artificial intelligence (AI), especially for real-world AI applications. It is impossible to apply AI in the real-world without its being trustworthy. However, the connotation and extension of trustworthiness are not entirely clear to the scientific community. There has not been a single definition that is accepted by all researchers. Nevertheless, the vast majority of researchers agree that AI trustworthiness should include at least accuracy, reliability, robustness, safety, security, privacy, fairness, transparency, controllability, maintenability, etc. This talk first reviews briefly concepts like trust, trustworthiness and trustworthy systems in engineering. Then we discuss what might be new in trustworthy AI. It is argued that AI ethics is a crucial part of trustworthy AI, which was not highlighted in traditional trustworthy systems. We present a hirarchical and multi-dimensioanl view of AI ethics, including fairness, transparency, safety, etc. Finally, we focus on the latest technical solutions to some trustworthy issues in machine learning, including fairness, explanability and safety. It is shown how multi-objective evolutionary learning can be used as an effective approach to enhancing AI trustworthiness. </p>

        <div class="abstract">
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Secure and federated data-driven optimization is an emerging research area that aims to protect the data security and privacy used in optimization. This talk starts with an introduction to basic ideas of data-driven optimization and federated privacy-preserving data-driven optimization. To protect the privacy of both offline and online data, we introduce a secure federated data-driven optimization framework based on the Diffie-Hellman protocol, in which a semi-honest client is randomly chosen to solve the acquisition function and determine the next sample point, making sure that newly sampled data is also protected. To reduce the negative impact of the noise added in differential privacy, a utility function is proposed to optimize the noise level that can optimally balance privacy preservation and optimization performance. Finally, a federated multi-tasking data-driven optimization algorithm is presented that shares the hyperparameters of Gaussian processes for knowledge transfer, while protecting the data privacy. </p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has recently attracted great attention due to its importance in critical application domains such as self-driving cars, law, and healthcare. Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for AI, machine learning and AutoML. Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to the symbolic nature of the model structure. GP model interpretability has been playing an increasingly important role in XAI. This talk will first briefly overview explainable AI, then focus on how GP helps XAI in three aspects: intrinsic XGP, aiming to directly evolve more interpretable (and effective) models by GP; post-hoc XGP, which uses GP to explain other black-box machine learning models and the models evolved by GP by simpler models (e.g. linear models); and GP visualisation, which focuses on visual interpretability. Finally, I will discuss the challenges and future directions for XGP.    </p>
