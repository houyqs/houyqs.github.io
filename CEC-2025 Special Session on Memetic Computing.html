<h2 style="padding:10px; font-size:20px "Microsoft yahei"";>Scope and Topics</h2></p>
&emsp;&emsp;The Special Session on Memetic Computing (MC) is organized by IEEE CIS Emergent Technologies Task Force on Memetic Computing. MC is a paradigm that employs memes, which are units of information, encoded in computational representations to solve problems. The concept of memes within MC is commonly understood as individual learning procedures, adaptive improvement procedures, or local search operators that enhance the effectiveness of population-based search algorithms. Additionally, new manifestations of memes, such as knowledge building-blocks, decision trees, artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and graphs, have been proposed to facilitate efficient problem-solving. These algorithms, frameworks, and paradigms inspired by memes have demonstrated considerable success in various real-world applications. The purpose of this special session is to provide researchers with a platform to share the latest advancements in theories, technologies, and practical applications of MC.
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;The topics of this special session include but are not limited to the following topics: <br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Single/Multi-objective/multi-tasking memetic algorithms<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Memetic algorithms for continuous or combinatorial optimization<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Theoretical studies that enhance our understandings on the behaviors of memetic computing<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Adaptive systems and meme coordination<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Novel manifestations of memes for problem-solving<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Cognitive, brain, individual learning, and social learning inspired memetic computation<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Novel competitive, collaborative and cooperative frameworks of memetic computation<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Memetic frameworks using surrogate or approximation methods to solve expensive and complex real-world problems<br />
&emsp;&emsp;● Data mining, machine learning, knowledge learning and generative intelligence in memetic computation paradigm<br />
